### Hi there 👋

My name is **Emi Tanaka** and I like coding 😄

* 💬 &nbsp;I can speak English, Japanese and R (base + tidyverse) fluently
* 🔭 &nbsp;I’m currently working on the [grammar of experimental design](https://github.com/emitanaka/edibble), statistical graphics research, among other things
* 🌱 &nbsp;I’m looking to collaborate on selective breeding projects (particularly crops)
* 👩🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Pronouns: She/her
* 📫 &nbsp;How to reach me: 
  * For my github repos, filing an an issue in the corresponding github repo.
  * For R help or related, stackoverflow or some other public forum so other people can benefit from your question (please don't email me R questions!).
  * For asreml or analysis/design of crop field trials, please see [my slides for "Statistical Methods for Omics Assisted Breeding"](https://emitanaka.org/workshop/). I can deliver workshops on this if there is sufficient interest and someone is willing to organise this. Please note that I'm not a help desk for how to code asreml or how to analyse your plant breeding data so please don't email me these if it is not relevant to the work I do. 
  * For others, email emi.tanaka@monash.edu.
